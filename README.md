## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/number-recognition.git
    ```
2. Change to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd number-recognition
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the number recognition model, execute the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then, open the `number recognezation.ipynb` notebook and run the cells to train and test the model.

## Dataset

This project uses the MNIST dataset, which is a large dataset of handwritten digits. The dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each of which is a 28x28 grayscale image of a single digit (0-9).

## Model

The model is implemented using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately classify the digits. The architecture consists of:

- Input Layer: 28x28 grayscale images
- Convolutional Layers: Extracting features
- Pooling Layers: Reducing dimensionality
- Fully Connected Layers: Final classification

## Results

The model achieves a high accuracy on the MNIST dataset. Here are some of the results:

- Training Accuracy: 100%
- Testing Accuracy: 100%
